# list-of-authors
there is a table - list of authors with dynamically added rows. we're able to delete and edit these rows and check empty inputs. Also we can save data in local storage. the same concerns the second table with list of books of definite author. besides we can search a book by title.
this application was produced by means of Angularjs & Bootstrap(model) and non-model version using JS & jQuery library.
